<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/06/03/15/0454259.shtml">slasdotted today</a>.

Both <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/news/nuxeo-releases-cps-3-4">the announcement on nuxeo.com</a> (which runs CPS 3.3.8) and the brand new <a href="http://www.cps-project.org/">cps-project.org</a> (which has been upgraded to CPS 3.4.0, and which sports a new home page and updated content), where linked from the Slashdot news.

Despite the increase in visits number, the server (which hosts both sites, as well as a few others) hasn't had the slightest hickup, thanks to the performances work we've done during the CPS 3.3/3.4 development cycle.
