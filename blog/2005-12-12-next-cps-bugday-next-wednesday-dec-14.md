Next CPS bugday will happen on IRC channel #cps next wednesday (dec 14). There are still 77 issues left before we release CPS 3.4.0, but we are confident that the number will drop to a less spectacular level with the help of the CPS developers community at large, and the dedication of the CPS core team.
