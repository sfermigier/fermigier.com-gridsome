<p>
Our friend at <a href="http://www.cea.fr/">CEA</a> (French Atomic Energy Commission) have been awarded
"best project of the year" in the "public administration" category of the competition organised by the french magazine "Le Monde Informatique" (an IDG publication). They have
been using CPS for 3 years and now have 129 instances in production.
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.idg.fr/TROPHEES2006/telechargement/LMI_Trophees.pdf">the article (p. 19)</a>, the use of CPS has allowed for 1.9 to 3.8 millions Euros savings over 3 years.
</p><p>
(Note: last year, CPS won 2 awards in the same competition, one for <a href="http://www.cncc.fr/">CNCC.fr</a> and a second one for <a href="http://www.ardeche.fr/">Ardeche.fr</a>! Check for yourself in <a href="http://www.idg.fr/TROPHEES2006/telechargement/LMI1065.pdf">last year's article</a>).
