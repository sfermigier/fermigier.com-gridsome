<p>Work has started on two large scale R&amp;D projects, financed in part by the French Government and Paris Region (for Scribo), and by the European Commission (for IKS).</p><ul><li><p>Scribo (<a href="http://www.scribo.ws/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome">http://www.scribo.ws/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome</a>) aims at integrating language and image analysis technologies, as well as ontologies extractions and annotation techniques, into content management systems.
Work on the project is now in the design phase, but expect to see some code related the UIMA (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UIMA">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UIMA</a>) in our repository in the following moths.</p></li>
<li><p>IKS (<a href="http://www.iks-project.eu/">http://www.iks-project.eu/</a>) is a 4 year project funded by a 6.5 MEUR grant from the EC which aims to bridge the gap between researchers in the area of semantics and interactive knowledge, and small to medium size companies in the fields of Content Management and Knowledge Management. Its end  major technological result of the project will be the &#8220;Interactive Knowledge Stack&#8221;, a layered set of software components and specifications which will make traditional content management platforms capable of dealing with the future &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221;.</p></li>
