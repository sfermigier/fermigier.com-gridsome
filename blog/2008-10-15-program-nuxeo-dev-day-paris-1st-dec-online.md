I&#8217;m happy to report that we&#8217;ve finished setting up the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/events/first-nuxeo-developer/">conference program</a> for the first Nuxeo Developer Day in Paris, which will take place on 1st December, as a &#8220;community session&#8221; during the awesome <a href="http://www.openworldforum.org/">Open World Forum 2008</a>.
  
The conference will be a unique opportunity for you to meet and discuss with the Nuxeo core developers, and to exchange your experiences as users of the framework with fellow Nuxeo applications developers.

Only caveat: there are a limited number of available seats (50) and if you intend to attend (attendance is free, BTW), we ask you to say so by sending a mail to devday@nuxeo.com.
