We have been so busy the last couple of months working on customers projects that the 5.1 release has slipped a bit, but I&#8217;m happy to report that <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/news/nuxeo-5-1-release/">we have just released Nuxeo 5.1 RC</a>.
  
The final release (Nuxeo 5.1.0.GA) will be made next week, and then we&#8217;ll spend the rest of August:

<ul>
<li><p>finishing and polishing the <a href="http://doc.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo Book</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>planning and starting the next iteration of Nuxeo (5.2, cf. <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/about/roadmap/">the current roadmap</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Working on new customers projects (including some that feature the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/apogee/">Apogee Project</a> which has already seen a recent surge of activity).</p></li>
<li><p>getting some holidays :)</p></li>
</ul>
