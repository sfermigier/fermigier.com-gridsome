(A new series of post dedicated to interesting stuff found on the web).

## Writing desktop apps using web technologies

[Chromium as an embedded platform](https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/) for desktop apps.

... with [Python bindings](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/).

... used by [Inky](http://inky.com/), (yet another) "next gen" email client, build w/ Python and Chromium. Unfortunately I'm not convinced.

BTW, [dotMail](http://dotmailapp.com/) is another supposedly insanely great mail app that will probably never be built.

RIP Titanium Desktop (now TideSDK):

A pricier (non open source) solution:

(doesn't seem to have much traction either).

## Productivity porn

[Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/): GTD like methods based on a pocket notebook.

GTD meets Kanban: <http://creatingpersonalflow.com/blog/category/merging-gtd-and-kanban>

Interesting blog: <http://creatingpersonalflow.com/>

[Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/) seems to be the trendy GTD app at this point. Omnifocus seems to be considered as too rigid by many.
