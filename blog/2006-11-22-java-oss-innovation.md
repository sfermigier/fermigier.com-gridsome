<p>&#8220;Cristiano&#8221;, from Faqs.it, has written a comment about our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/news/nuxeo-switches-to-java/">switch from Python to Java</a> in <a href="http://blog.faqs.it/?p=15">his blog</a>.</p><p>Here is my comment about his comment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Cristiano,</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for your comments about our Java switch. I fully agree with you that a lot of innovations come from the OSS ecosystem, but there are some wrong facts in your remarks that I have to correct, including the following:</p>
  
  <ul><li><p>Python, for instance, did actually copy Java&#8217;s syntax (and concept) for annotation (called <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorators</a> in Python-speak), not the other way around.</p></li>
  <li><p>Generics are irrelevant in dynamics languages, hence dynamic languages can&#8217;t have &#8220;out-innovated&#8221; Java on that matter.</p></li>
  <li><p>The sentence &#8220;Python doesn&#8217;t fit in the enterprise-class web apps market&#8221; is in part irrelevant for us, because we are not <em>only</em> in the <em>web</em> apps market, but also in the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/apogee">rich client market</a> (with Eclipse RCP).</p></li>
  <li><p>Your opposition (in the last sentence) of &#8220;Java vs. OSS&#8221; is completely disconnected from the reality: Java is <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/fueling_the_network_effect">GPL</a> now (or will be RSN), Java OSS communities (JBoss, Spring, Apache, Eclipse, Nuxeo&#8230;) are among the most active (if not the most active) OSS communities now. And some of these communities have a lot of money at their disposal, because these are projects for building enterprise-class OSS software (or middleware), backed by serious companies like Sun, IBM, Red Hat, or Nuxeo.</p></li>
  </ul><p>IMHO, OSS is now driving, in many ways, the development of Java, and this means that there is no need to oppose Java if you are (like I am) an OSS believer.</p>
