As anounced in the <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/">mailing lists</a>, but not on this blog, today is the first "CPS Bug Day".

We intend to triage and fix a maximum number of bugs and issues in the current development branch (CPS 3.3.x), to prepare the next CPS 3.3.6 release (hopefully the last one before CPS 3.4).

So if you are interested in helping the CPS team, please join the #cps channel on IRC (on the Freenode network).
