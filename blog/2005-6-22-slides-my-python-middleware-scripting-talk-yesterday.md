I did a presentation yesterday at the ObjectWeb consortium architect seminar
about &quot;Python for middleware scripting&quot; (trying to push Python to a Java
crowd - not that easy). The <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/publications/slides/python-for-scripting/downloadFile/file/python.pdf">
slides are available (PDF, 800 kb)</a>. If you have comments on the slides 
(which were written in a bit of a hurry without the time to check all the 
information), I'd be glad to hear from you (-&gt; sf@nuxeo.com).
