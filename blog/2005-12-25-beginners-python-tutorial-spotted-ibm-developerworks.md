<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-python1/">Discover
  Python</a> is a series of articles written by Robert Brunner, Research
  Scientist at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and
  published by IBM DeveloperWorks.<br><br>
   According to the intro:<br><blockquote>
   The flexible nature of the Python programming language supports multiple
   programming philosophies, including procedural, object-oriented, and
   functional. But most importantly, programming in Python is fun. The
   language supports rather than hinders the development process.<br></blockquote>
  The articles are very basic, and clearly aimed at scientists with little
  knowledge in programming.<br><br>

  Greg Wilson.<br>
