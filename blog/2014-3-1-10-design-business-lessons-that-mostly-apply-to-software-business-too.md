From [What Bill Knew](http://observatory.designobserver.com/feature/what-bill-knew/38338/):

- Focusing on making a partnership work is more profitable than focusing on making money.

- Love your employees more than you love your clients. 

- The best new business is your current business.

- Price projects by asking yourself what the client's lawyer would charge.

- It's better to be hired for your work than for your price. 

- When it comes to getting paid, the first of the month is better than the thirtieth. 

- Making money off mechanicals, printing and computers turns your business into a commodity. 

- The books in your library are more important than the numbers on your balance sheet. 

- In order to love your work, take vacations.

- Power, in business, comes from sharing money and valuing love.
