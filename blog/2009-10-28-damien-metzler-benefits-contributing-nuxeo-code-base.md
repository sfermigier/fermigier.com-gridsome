Damien Metlzer, who's with Leroy Merlin and has been working on <a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/dev/2009/10/nuxeo-dm-53-release-notes.html#opensocial">OpenSocial integration</a> in Nuxeo EP, has an <a href="http://dmetzler.posterous.com/opensource-work-opensocial-integration-in-nux">extensive blog post</a> about the history of this significant contribution to the Nuxeo EP code base.</quote></p> 

<p>Here are, according to him, some of the benefits of contributing to Nuxeo:</p> 

<ul><li><em>Our code is reviewed by Nuxeo Architects and well integrated in the core distribution.</em></li>
<li><em>We had to make the generic code generic, and make the specific parts plugin of it.&#160; I really think its a proof a quality and that i made us ask for the good questions.</em></li>
<li><em>Apart from making the code generic, it did cost us nothing</em></li>
<li><em>I think that the value of a portal is the number of app you can integrate into it. Theorically we have all iGoogle gadgets that are integrable (and that makes a lot ;-) ). I other people contribute by making "Enterprise ready gadgets" on top of the Nuxeo Platform, we will gain benefit from it (if you want some ideas, call me ;-) )</em></li>
<li><em>As funny as it could be, as we have a Nuxeo Connect Support, we could post JIRA tickets about our own bugs (really funny :-p)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So once again, many thanks to you and your team on behalf of the Nuxeo community.</p>
