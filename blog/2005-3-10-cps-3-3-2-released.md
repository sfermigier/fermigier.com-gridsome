We have released CPS 3.3.2. It is a development release but it should be
fairly stable.

(And:<a href="http://www.cps-project.org/sections/downloads/debian/view">http://www.cps-project.org/sections/downloads/debian/view</a> 
for the Debian packages).

What's new ?

<ul>
<li>New module: CPSWiki (simple Wiki, nothing fancy yet)</li>
<li>Many (to many to report quickly) changes to other packages (828 commits
by 18 developers since 3.3.1)</li>
</ul>
