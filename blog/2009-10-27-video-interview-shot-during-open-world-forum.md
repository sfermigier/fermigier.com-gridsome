 <p><strong>Here is a rough transcript</strong>:</p> 
 <p>
<em>Nuxeo is the pioneer and leader of ECM. Our software is used by large companies throughout the world to help them manage all their documents and digital assets, such as images or emails.</em>
</p> <p>
<em>Nuxeo is an open source vendor. That means we are developing a platform, a technology, in a completely open source and transparent way. Everyone can access our source code, make contributions and participate in our community. And we work with partners, such as systems integrators or vertical application vendors, to help them create specific applications that are used by the end users. These applications can deal with aspects such as collaboration, workflow, compliance on processes around documents. Since our technology is base on open source Java, it is very easy to set up, to customize and to extend for systems integrators, because a lot of people around the world already know the Java programming language, and there are a lot of supporting tools.</em>
</p> <p>
<em>Nuxeo is quite satisfied by its current situation. We are selling new contracts every day in several different countries. We are growing, in France and in the USA, and we are looking for <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/careers">15 new people to hire in our team</a>.</em></p> 
 <p>A similar interview has also <a href="http://www.tivipro.tv/chaine_salons.php?id=1804464&amp;id_salon=374&amp;pageIndex=2">been conducted in French</a>.</p>
