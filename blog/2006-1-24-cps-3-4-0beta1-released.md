<a href="http://www.cps-project.org/sections/news/cps-3-4-0beta1-released">announcements</a>
  for the<a href="http://www.cps-project.org/static/src/CPS-3.4.0beta1.tar.gz">CPS 3.4.0
  beta1 release</a>. It was a bit tiring since many things have changed since
  CPS 3.3.8 (we did an "alpha" in late december, but it was not packaged, just
  an annoucement in the dev mailing list).<br><br>
   There is still a lot of work to finish before we finish (at least a beta2)
  but I'm confident we are on the right track.
