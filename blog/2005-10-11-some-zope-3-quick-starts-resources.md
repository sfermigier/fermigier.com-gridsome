reminder for several introductory documents and tutorials about Zope
3</a>.

Nice thing about it is that he even mentions<a href="http://www.z3lab.org/">z3lab.org</a>, a project dear to us at
Nuxeo:

<blockquote>
This site has blogs, documentation, proposals, movies, prototypes, and
more, for building a high class content management platform on top of the
Zope 3 framework. There is a lot of information and ideas floating around
here, and the animations are very impressive.
