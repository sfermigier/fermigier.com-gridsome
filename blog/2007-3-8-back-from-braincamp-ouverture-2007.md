<p>As some people know already, I have participated in the creation of <a href="http://www.ouverture-paris-region.org/xwiki/bin/Main/">Ouverture</a> (n&#233; &#8220;Open Source Valley&#8221;), the Competitiveness cluster dedicated to Free and Open Source Software in the Paris area.</p><p>We are still waiting for the official stamp of the French Government, which will start the operational life of the cluster by bringing Government funding to R&amp;D projects carried out by the cluster&#8217;s members: public research labs, universities and companies. Since there seems to be some, let&#8217;s say &#8220;bureaucratic delays&#8221;, we had decided to start some activities that don&#8217;t depend on the official stamp, namely bringing together all the cluster&#8217;s participants to brainstorm ideas for projects that would be later submitted to the cluster.</p><p>This first event was christened &#8220;<a href="http://www.ouverture-paris-region.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/BrainCamp0207">BrainCamp 2007</a>&#8221; and happened today at ENSTA, a Parisian engineering school that has been a pionneer in the use of open source software in higher education in France.</p>

<p>Like every SME that participated in this BrainCamp, I had 5 minutes to present Nuxeo to the other participants: about 15 research labs, 20 SMEs (including the biggest names in the French open source market: Mandriva, Idealx, Linagora, XWiki, etc.) and 4 big companies (which happen, can you believe it, to be all partners of Nuxeo: Capgemini, Unilog, CS, Sun).</p>

<p>My point was to present the most innovative aspects of the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo 5</a> project: its use of <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/runtime/">Nuxeo Runtime</a> to develop modular applications that target both application servers and rich clients, the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/core/">Nuxeo Core</a> embeddable document management core, and the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/ep/">Nuxeo EP</a> and <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/rcp/">Nuxeo RCP</a> platforms. Hence we are looking for partners that would like to work with us on all kind of levels:</p>

<ul><li><p>Nuxeo Runtime: either developers of other kinds of enterprise software (ERP, CRM, Enterprise Wikis&#8230;) that would want to benefit from the modularity and extensibility that it provides, or people who would want to work with us on targeting other deployment platforms than JBoss AS 4 and Eclipse (we&#8217;re specially looking for volunteers for helping with porting Nuxeo Runtime to JBoss 5, JOnAS 5, Geronimo, Glassfish, for instance).</p></li>
<li><p>Nuxeo Core: developers that who would like to extend to core with new kinds of document storages than the JCR, for instance a RDBMS (via Hibernate), an OODBMS (like db4o) or an XML database, add application-level replication / synchronization, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Business components developers that would extend the platform with more specialized components.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertical application developers that would base their software on the Nuxeo platform (we already have a bunch of companies we are working with on this matter).</p></li>
<li><p>Other kinds of applications developers (ex: CRM, ERP, etc.) that would want either to embed Nuxeo as a document management core in their system (this makes completely sense for a system like a CRM that has to manage document besides more structured data) or just connect Nuxeo to their software.</p></li>
