system of choice.</EM>

PC running Linux.  And oh! It was as though the heavens opened and God
handed down a client-side OS so beautiful, so graceful, and so elegant
that a million Microsoft developers couldn't have invented it even if
they had a hundred years and a thousand crates of Jolt cola.

[...] at this point Linux is a more credible challenge to the Windows desktop
than the Java network computer.
